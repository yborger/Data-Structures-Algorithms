1. What is your name?  What do you prefer to be called?
My name is Yael, and I go by Yael. I use she/they pronouns.


2. Why are you taking CS35?
I am taking CS35 because I enjoy computer science and algorithms
are actually one of my favorite parts of programming.


3. What is your previous experience in Computer Science?  What
programming languages do you know, and which classes have you taken?
I have taken CS31 at Swarthmore, but not CS21 as I tested out of it. 
I also took AP Computer Science Principles and AP Computer Science A
in high school. I learned C, JAVA, and Javascript.


4. These are a couple questions about how you approach your assignments.

  a. Do you start on your homework as soon as it is assigned or do you
  tend to finish it right before it's due?
  I tend to be right in the middle, where I don't do my homework immediately
  when it is given, but I try to do it a safe amount of time before the 
  due date (like a few days if possible).
  
  
  b. When doing group work, do you prefer for your group to split your
  work up into pieces or do you like to work together as a group
  through as much of the material as possible?
  I like working as a group through the whole thing so that everyone is on the 
  same page as we do the work.


5. What do you consider fun?
  I think typing itself is quite fun, especially when you actually know what 
  you are typing to begin with and it all just flows through as you go.
